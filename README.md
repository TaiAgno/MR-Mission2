# Mission 2

## Description

This project was developed to create an interface to provide a car value from two inputs, car model and car year.
For that, it was used Express to emulate a server, JSON for parsing, Jest for testing and Postman for interface.
TDD principles were applied, using the logic of red, green, refactor.

SELF-DISCLAIMER

I have very limited experience with JavaScript, and using Node, JSON and Express is almost completely new to me, so I understand this code is quite infantile. As I see it, a good analogy is a stickman drawing from a kindergarden child, comparing to hyper-realistic drawings from colleagues and group mates.
